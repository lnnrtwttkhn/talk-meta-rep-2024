## Abstract

**Title:** Science as distributed open-source knowledge development

Inadequate reproducibility, a lack of transparency, and inefficient workflows - many scientific disciplines have a pressing need for innovation.
Additionally, the research process is becoming increasingly digital, computational, and collaborative.
I argue that technical solutions to these challenges already exist and can be found in professional software development.
These solutions primarily include tools for collaborative version control of code and data, such as Git or DataLad, as well as software containers like Docker.
I will discuss how these tools are transforming scientific workflows and identify the (predominantly non-technical) hurdles that exist regarding their implementation.

**Keywords:** reproducibility, collaboration, version control, digital research skills, science reform

### META-REP 2024

Taken from [the conference website](https://www.conference2024.meta-rep.uni-muenchen.de/index.html):

> We are delighted to announce META-REP 2024 – the Conference on Meta-Science and Replicability in the social, behavioral, and cognitive sciences. It will be held from October 28 to 31, 2024 in Munich. The conference is organized by the DFG-funded Priority Program META-REP.

> In recent years, replicability, reproducibility, robustness, and validity of empirical findings became a focal and intensively debated and researched topic in the behavioral and social sciences. Aside from an intensive scientific discourse, these dynamics caused demands for change and innovation. In response to these developments, the META-REP program is oriented towards three main (meta-)scientific research goals: (1) to define, describe, and assess "replicability"" (the what-question), (2) to provide explanations for replication rates, heterogeneity and deviation in replication results (the why-question), and (3) to assess effectiveness and efficiency of strategies and change aimed at improving robustness (the how-question). We are convinced that many scholars in the fields of the behavioral and social sciences can contribute valuable findings, ideas, and discussions to (one of) these three goals. We are excited to provide a platform for the exchange of manifold replication-related research findings and innovation from all scientific disciplines (as well as science communicators, delegates from funding agencies, academies, or science organizations). We thus want to invite everyone whose work relates to one of the manifold aspects of replicability research to attend and/or contribute to META-REP 2024!
