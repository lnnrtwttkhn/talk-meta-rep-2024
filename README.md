## Abstract

**Title:** Science as distributed open-source knowledge development

Inadequate reproducibility, a lack of transparency, and inefficient workflows - many scientific disciplines have a pressing need for innovation.
Additionally, the research process is becoming increasingly digital, computational, and collaborative.
I argue that technical solutions to these challenges already exist and can be found in professional software development.
These solutions primarily include tools for collaborative version control of code and data, such as Git or DataLad, as well as software containers like Docker.
I will discuss how these tools are transforming scientific workflows and identify the (predominantly non-technical) hurdles that exist regarding their implementation.

**Keywords:** reproducibility, collaboration, version control, digital research skills, science reform
